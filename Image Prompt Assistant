User Input: "A dragon in a medieval city"
Generated Prompt:
"A majestic, emerald-scaled dragon with piercing golden eyes perched atop an ancient stone tower in a bustling medieval city. The dragonâ€™s wings are partially spread, glowing embers escaping from its nostrils as torches flicker below. The city is filled with cobblestone streets, medieval houses with wooden beams, and a large castle in the distance. The atmosphere is misty, with the warm glow of lanterns contrasting against the cool twilight sky. The scene is captured in a cinematic, high-detail fantasy art style, with dynamic lighting and a slightly low-angle perspective for an epic feel."
